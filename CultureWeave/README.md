VORTEX-AI-CultureWeave README
Overview
VORTEX-AI-CultureWeave is an innovative generative AI app for preserving and revitalizing indigenous knowledge through immersive storytelling. It generates personalized narratives, illustrations, and AR experiences to combat cultural erosion, fostering identity and community bonds. This project pioneers generative cultural toolsâ€”unmatched in its interactive scope.
Problem It Solves

Local Level (e.g., Kenya): Risks cultural loss for 42+ ethnic groups, disconnecting 70% of youth, leading to identity crises, $500 million tourism losses, weakened bonds, educational gaps, and reduced resilience.
Regional Level: Threatens 2,000 languages, affecting 300 million with education barriers, cohesion issues, and economic hurdles.
Broader Scale: Global indigenous knowledge loss (one language biweekly), endangering biodiversity solutions, $1 trillion heritage market, fragmentation, and diverse perspective erosion.

Key Features

Conversational Prompts: Create stories in native languages (e.g., "Weave a legend with my family's twist").
Generative Outputs: Narrated audios, illustrations, branching stories, music fusions, AR overlays.
Advanced Capabilities: Elder crowdsourcing, digital archiving, generative translations, offline creation, privacy for sacred content.

Technical Stack

Conversational AI: Adaptive dialogues with emotional matching.
Generative Components: Text-to-speech/images; LLMs for bias-checked content.
Efficiency: Edge-optimized; fine-tuning for thousands of languages.
Additional: Sensitivity filters; heritage database integration.
